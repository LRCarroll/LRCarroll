**Supervisor:** <a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/contact-us/people/alison-downard.html">Prof. Alison Downard</a>

**Co-supervisor:** <a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/engineering/contact-us/people/martin-allen.html">Prof. Martin Allen</a>

**Thesis:** *Covalently-Bound Organic Modification of Transparent Metal Oxides: Effects on the Chemical and Electronic Surface Properties*

**Overiew:**


### Visiting Researcher (November 2018 - December 2018)
<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/department-of-physics.html">Department of Physics</a>, University of Auckland

**Supervisor:** <a href="https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/n-gaston">A/Prof. Nicola Gaston</a>

**Overview:**A visiting researcher for 6 weeks where the fundimental computation techniques for surface modifications were learnt. This work ended up being one chapter in my thesis.

**Topic:** *Ultra-High Temperature Electrolysis to Produce Titanium*

**Overiew:** Conducted thermodynamic calculates relating to the electrolysis of slag and evaluate <a href="https://thermocalc.com/">Thermo-Calc</a> as a viable software package for this.


### Bachelor of Science with Honours (March 2017 - December 2017)
<a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools-and-departments/phys-chem/">School of Physical and Chemical Sciences</a>, University of Canterbury

**Supervisor:** <a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/contact-us/people/alison-downard.html">Prof. Alison Downard</a>

**Co Supervisor:** <a href="https://researchprofile.canterbury.ac.nz/Researcher.aspx?researchername=Mark%20Peter%20Staiger">A/Prof. Mark Staiger</a>

**Thesis:** [*Novel Coatings for Improving the Corrosion Resistance of Mg Biomedical Implants*](assets/Liam Carroll - Honours Thesis.pdf)

**Abstract:** This study looked at the functionalisation of Mg using aryldiazonium chemistry to decrease the corrosion properties of the metal and successfully modified the surface.
