**Who am I?**

I am currently in the process of completing my PhD in chemistry from the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. I have also completed a BSc(Hons) in chemistry and a BSc majoring in chemistry and mathematics, also from the University of Canterbury. My graduate research focuses on the chemical modification of transparent semiconducting materials to alter their electronic properties for use in devices.

This is my personal website. The views expressed on this page are mine alone and not those of any organisation I am related to.
