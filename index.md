Kia Ora, my name is Liam Carroll a human being from New Zealand

<p>I am currently in the process of completing my PhD in chemistry from the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. I am currently scheduled to defend my thesis at the end of April 2022. I have also completed a BSc(Hons) in chemistry and a BSc majoring in chemistry and mathematics, also from the University of Canterbury. My graduate research focuses on the chemical modification of transparent semiconducting materials to alter their electronic properties for use in devices.</p>

I am currently looking to expand my horizons in Europe and if you have any interesting opportunities, please feel free to contact me below.

This is my personal website. The views expressed on this page are mine alone and not those of any organisation I am related to.

This website is a work in progress, and will be updated when I have time.
